# universify
the beginning of a spotify api project, by luis jaco.
school data origin: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashgpt/us-college-data (thank you kaggle.)
the data was heavily stripped and then reformated into json by me.
thank you to anyone who sees this <3

Universify is a program for viewing and adding top genre data for specific schools using the Spotify API.
Use your personal Spotify account to view your top genres and add them to your schools data.

* currently i do not verify that you actually go to the school so just be a honest person ok.
* if you would like to see an example of this program you can look for the school 
* NEW YORK INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (state: ny, zip: 11568, id: 1966)

* DUE TO MY SPOTIFY APPLICATION BEING DEVELOPMENTAL, I HAVE TO MANUALLY ENTER ANYONE WHO USES THIS APPLICATION TO ADD DATA.
* IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS APPLICATION YOU CAN CONTACT ME AT: LUISJACOO04@GMAIL.COM

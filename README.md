# universify
Welcome to Universify! A program made by Luis Jaco.

Universify is a program for viewing and adding top genre data for specific schools using the Spotify API.

Features:
- View different schools genre data (top genres).
- View genres stats per grade (for example: freshman, seniors).
- Add your top three genres to a schools data (using your Spotify account).

This is my first full project, feedback is heavily appreciated!

* Due to the way the Spotify API works, a small project like this cannot be used without manual entry into a system which allows other Spotify users to use this program. If you are interested in using the 'adding data' portion of this program for yourself you can contact me at luisjacoo04@gmail.com

* If you would like to see an example of the data portion of this program you can look for the school: NEW YORK INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (state: ny, zip: 11568, id: 1966) (my school and data).

* Where I got the list of schools: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashgpt/us-college-data (thank you kaggle.) the data was heavily edited and then reformated into json by me.
